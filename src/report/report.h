/** \defgroup report_api Report API
 * @{
 * This API is designed to load plugin libraries to report some information to EARD, to EARDBD,
 * to different databases and what the programmer wants, such as text files. You have to pass an
 * installation path and a list of library files sepparated by ':'. If installation path is NULL,
 * it will use the current path. If not, it will search in INSTALL_PATH/lib/plugins/report/ folder.
 * The library files have to include the '.so' extension.
 *
 * Props:
 *     - Thread safe: yes.
 *     - User mode: yes, if the plugin does user operations.
