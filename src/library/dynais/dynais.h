/*
 * Usage summary:
 * Just call dynais() passing the sample and the size of this sample. It will be
 * returned one of these states:
 *      END_LOOP
 *      NO_LOOP
 *      IN_LOOP
 *      NEW_ITERATION
 *      NEW_LOOP
 *      END_NEW_LOOP
 *
 * To initialize, you have to call dynais_init() method before, passing a
 * topology, window length and number of levels. The function
 * dynais_dispose() frees its memory allocation.
 *
 * Level is capped to a maximum of 10, and window to 40.000. But it is
 * recommended to set a window of 500 at most to perform at its best.
 *
 * Errors:
 * A NULL returned by dynais_init() means that something went wrong while
 * allocating memory.
